# Embed

An easy way to embed media to your Rails app. Don't worry about messy embedding HTML anymore, just use the media URL.

As of now, it only supports YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia and SoundCloud.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'embed'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install embed

## Usage

```ruby
<%= embed("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwncgZ15RVQ") %>
